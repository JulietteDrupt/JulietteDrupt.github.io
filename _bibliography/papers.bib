	abstract = {In the field of underwater robotics, tethers are the dominant method used to provide real time communication with underwater vehicles. Estimating their shape is a key element in preventing entanglements and limiting their mechanical effects on the vehicles. In addition, the tether shape constrains the pose of the vehicle at its attachment point, and could thus be used for vehicle localization purposes given an accurate tether model. This work focuses on a simple model of flexible non-rigid hanging cables, namely the catenary model, and presents an experimental evaluation of the validity of this model to approximate the shape of dynamically moving underwater tethers with negative buoyancy using motion tracking.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the relevance of using catenary-based curves to model cables in underwater tethered robotic applications in order to take into account the influence of hydrodynamic damping. To this end, an augmented catenarybased model is introduced to deal with the dynamical effects of surge motion, sway motion or a combination of both on a cable. Experimental studies are carried out with eight cables of varying stiffness, weight and buoyancy. One end of the cable is fixed, while the other end is moved by the underwater robot. The obtained results help to determine which cables and which dynamics are compatible with a fair estimation of the cable shape through the proposed models.},

	abstract = {This article describes an affordable and setupfriendly cable-based localization technique for underwater remotely operated vehicles, which exploits the piecewise linear shape of the umbilical being equipped with a sliding ballast. Each stretched part of the cable is instrumented with a waterproof inertial measurement unit (IMU) to measure its orientation. Using the cable’s geometry, the vehicle’s location can be calculated in relation to the ﬁxed or moving end of the cable. Experiments carried out with a robotic system in a water tank prove the reliability of this localization strategy. The study investigates the inﬂuence of measurement uncertainties on cable orientation and length, as well as the impact of the IMU location along the cable on localization precision. The accuracy of the localization method is discussed.},
