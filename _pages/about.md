I received the Graduate degree in computer science and robotics from the École Nationale Supérieure des Mines de Saint-Etienne, France, in 2020, and the Ph.D. degree in robotics from the [COSMER lab](https://cosmer.univ-tln.fr/en/), University of Toulon, La Valette du Var, France, in 2023, focusing on localization and mapping for underwater tethered robots. I was a Postdoctoral Researcher with Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, U.K, in the [Ocean Systems Lab](https://oceansystemslab.github.io/). In 2024, I joined the University of Montpellier, Montpellier, France, as Assistant Professor, and I am currently part of the [Underwater Robotics Team of the Laboratoire d’Informatique, de Robotique et de Microélectronique de Montpellier (LIRMM)](https://www.lirmm.fr/teams-en/rsm-en/). I am also a lecturer at [IUT GEII Montpellier-Sète](https://iutgeii.umontpellier.fr/).

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
